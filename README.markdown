# Duplo (C/C++/Java Duplicate Source Code Block Finder)

Personal fork to add support for qml files (very similar or identical to javascript)

The rest of the README file is of the project from where I forked.


# GENERAL INFORMATION

Duplicated source code blocks can harm maintainability of software systems.
Duplo is a tool to find duplicated code blocks in large C, C++, Java, C# and 
VB.Net systems.

Sample output snippet:

    ...
    src\engine\geometry\simple\TorusGeometry.cpp(56)
    src\engine\geometry\simple\SphereGeometry.cpp(54)
	    pBuffer[currentIndex*size+3]=(i+1)/(float)subdsU;
	    pBuffer[currentIndex*size+4]=j/(float)subdsV;
	    currentIndex++;
	    pPrimitiveBuffer->unlock();

    src\engine\geometry\subds\SubDsGeometry.cpp(37)
    src\engine\geometry\SkinnedMeshGeometry.cpp(45)
        pBuffer[i*size+0]=m_ct[0]->m_pColors[i*3];
        pBuffer[i*size+1]=m_ct[0]->m_pColors[i*3+1];
        pBuffer[i*size+2]=m_ct[0]->m_pColors[i*3+2];
    ...

## OPTIONS

Run "duplo --help" on the command line to see the detailed options.

## FEEDBACK AND BUG REPORTING

Please send Feedback and Bug Reports to: dlidstrom@gmail.com

## FILE LIST GENERATION

Generate a list of all files of a directory with:

### Windows

    dir /s /b /a-d *.cpp *.h > files.lst

### UNIX

    find -name "*.cpp" > cppList.lst
    find -name "*.h" > includeList.lst
    cat cppList.lst includeList.lst > all.lst

# BACKGROUND

Duplo uses the same techniques as Duploc to detect duplicated code blocks. See
[Duca99bCodeDuplication](http://www.iam.unibe.ch/~scg/Archive/Papers/Duca99bCodeDuplication.pdf) for
further information.
